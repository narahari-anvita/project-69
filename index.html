                <p>School Is Trying To Do: Students can get inspired by each other and every student to learn and thrive as creators of their future world.Sense of Belonging to the Great Cherry Crest Comm(UNITY):All teachers deliver evidence-based universal Social Emotional Learning (SEL) instruction in their classrooms tostudents as evidenced by the SEL look-for document and create plans for implementation improvement based on strengths and areas for growth.During remote learning and to ensure physical safety during the pandemic, we creatively use song and dance to promote our Three Rs and schoolwide expectations, as well as to showcase student voice in a creative and fun way. This serves as a school motto to bring us all together.During the school year, students receive a virtual or physical postcard to their student email/home address from a staff member at Cherry Crest, recognizing students’ hard work and demonstration of our Three Rs. All students receive the Bullying Prevention Unit lessons, required for their grade level.All General School Assistants receive explicit training on Restorative Practices, Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports and Social Emotional Learning. The training aims to improve student well-being and sense of belonging during unstructured times (i.e. lunch and recess).In partnership with our PTSA, all students receive a free Read-a-Thon t-shirt to support our school and to build community for this community-wide event.<br><br>What is unique about Cherry Crest?One of four Bellevue elementary schools with a self-contained Advanced Learning program for qualifying students in grades 2-5.Strong PTSA and family engagement focused on enrichment opportunities for all students, as well as providing dollars toward classified staffing to allow for more instructional assistance throughout the building.Veteran staff with more than 10 years average experience and 60% with master’s degree education or higher.Diverse racial and multilingual student body representing 32 distinct foreign languages and 42% of students speaking a language other than English at home.</p>
